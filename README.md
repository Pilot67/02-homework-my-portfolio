This is my Professional portfolio web-site. The menu links at the top of the page will scroll the page to the sections - 'About Me' , 'My Projects' , 'Contact Information'.
The website is responsive and the menu will change to a 'Hamburger' style on mobile devices.
Please explore and leave me any commnets on improvements.
